U/R Design was contacted on short notice in January 2008 to deliver this project in time for a spring opening the same year. The scope of the project required a new kitchen, accessible toilet facilities, a new HVAC system, additional storage, and the maximizing of bookshelf space and seating.Within the first week of being hired, U/R Design provided a design which was approved by the client and was able to expedite the construction documents in time for the required opening date. In addition, U/R Design facilitated the addition of a MEP engineer (AEC Consultants, Avon, CO) and a structural engineer (Studer Engineering, Steamboat, CO) to the project team within days and start coordinating the architectural design with the structural and mechanical elements, crucial to proper coordination and expediting a building permit.

Due to a lack of storage compared to the previous location two blocks down, the architectural concept was to create a building within a building, thus focusing the majority of work in one location and combining the programmatic needs of the business. The solution: create a storage/office space above the new kitchen and toilet facilities while avoiding the retrofitting of these new spaces into the existing mezzanine. The structure of the new “box” was designed to incorporate different elements of the existing structure, to meet the ergonomic needs of the staff in the kitchen, while fitting within the requirements of the building codes. In the end, the space was changed into a fun, inspiring, and delightful space for it’s patrons to enjoy.
