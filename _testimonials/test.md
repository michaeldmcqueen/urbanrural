Brian Majeski worked with my taste and suggested great ideas to maximize light and space without an overblown price tag. He worked with my G.C. to get the project to permit, and the end result was an affordable project without compromising on quality. Brian was enthusiastic about the project and really worked to make me a satisfied customer very happy with the end result. Brian also stayed within his estimate which was very important for the project to be a success.
